  Connect Databend Cloud To Metabase
---

[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is a simple but powerful analytics tool that enables everyone to make business decisions using their data without requiring any technical skills.

Before connecting to Metabase, sign in to your account on [Databend Cloud](../index.md).

## Install Metabase

Metabase is a Java application that can be executed by simply downloading the [JAR file](https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/jar). To install Metabase, simply run this command:

> Note: Metabase requires that you have Java 8 or higher versions installed on your system.

```shell
java -jar metabase.jar
```

This will launch a Metabase server on port 3000 by default.

## Download the ClickHouse plugin for Metabase

Because Databend is compatible with the [ClickHouse protocol](../../30-reference/00-api/02-clickhouse-handler.md), we can use ClickHouse plugin to help Databend connect to Metabase.

1. In the folder where you saved the file metabase.jar, create a subfolder called plugins.

2. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/enqueue/metabase-clickhouse-driver/releases/latest) of the ClickHouse Metabase plugin to the folder you created in step 1. The plugin comes with a JAR file called clickhouse.metabase-driver.jar.

3. Run the command `java -jar metabase.jar` to restart Metabase to load the driver properly.

4. Access Metabse at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
