## Deploying a Standalone Databend

Databend works with both self-hosted and cloud object storage solutions. This topic explains how to deploy Databend with your object storage. For a list of supported object storage solutions, see [Understanding Deployment Modes](./00-understanding-deployment-modes.md).

### Setting up Your Object Storage

<TabItem value="MinIO" label="MinIO">

a. Follow the [MinIO Quickstart Guide](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html) to download and install the MinIO package to your local machine.

b. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where MinIO is stored.

c. Run the command `vim server.sh` to create a file with the following content:

```shell
~/minio$ cat server.sh
export MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin
./minio server --address :9900 ./data
```
d. Run the following commands to start the MinIO server:

```shell
chmod +x server.sh
./server.sh
```

e. In your browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:9900 and enter the credentials (`minioadmin` / `minioadmin`) to log in to the MinIO Console.

f. In the MinIO Console, create a bucket named `databend`.

Before deploying Databend, make sure you have successfully set up your object storage environment in the cloud, and the following tasks have been completed:

- Create a bucket or container named `databend`.
- Get the endpoint URL for connecting to the bucket or container you created.
- Get the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for your account.

For information about how to manage buckets and Access Keys for your cloud object storage, refer to the user manual from the solution provider. Here are some useful links you may need:

### Downloading Databend
a. Create a folder named `databend` in the directory `/usr/local`.

b. Download and extract the latest Databend package for your platform from https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/releases.

c. Move the extracted folders `bin` and `etc` to the folder `/usr/local/databend`.

### Deploying a Meta Node
a. Open the file `databend-meta-node.toml` in the folder `/usr/local/databend/etc`, and replace `0.0.0.0` with `127.0.0.1` within the whole file.

b. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder `/usr/local/databend/bin`.

c. Run the following command to start the Meta node:

```shell
./databend-meta -c ../etc/databend-meta.toml > meta.log 2>&1 &
```

d. Run the following command to check if the Meta node was started successfully:

```shell
curl -I  http://127.0.0.1:28101/v1/health
```

### Deploying a Query Node
a. Open the file `databend-query-node.toml` in the folder `/usr/local/databend/etc`, and replace `0.0.0.0` with `127.0.0.1` within the whole file.

b. In the file `databend-query-node.toml`, set the parameter `type` in [storage] block to `s3` if you're using a S3 compatible object storage, or `azblob` if you're using Azure Blob storage.

```toml
[storage]
# fs | s3 | azblob
type = "s3"
```

c. Comment out the [storage.fs] block first, and then uncomment the [storage.s3] block if you're using a S3 compatible object storage, or uncomment the [storage.azblob] block if you're using Azure Blob storage.

```toml
# Set a local folder to store your data.
# Comment out this block if you're NOT using local file system as storage.
#[storage.fs]
#data_path = "benddata/datas"

# To use S3-compatible object storage, uncomment this block and set your values.
[storage.s3]
bucket = "<your-bucket-name>"
endpoint_url = "<your-endpoint>"
access_key_id = "<your-key-id>"
secret_access_key = "<your-account-key>"

# To use Azure Blob storage, uncomment this block and set your values.
# [storage.azblob]
# endpoint_url = "https://<your-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net"
# container = "<your-azure-storage-container-name>"
# account_name = "<your-storage-account-name>"
# account_key = "<your-account-key>"
```

d. Set your values in the [storage.fs] or [storage.azblob] block. Please note that the field `endpoint_url` refers to the service URL of your storage region and varies depending on the object storage solution you use:

### Verifying Deployment
In this section, we will run MySQL queries from a SQL client installed on your local machine.

a. Create a connection to 127.0.0.1 from your SQL client. In the connection, set the port to `3307`, and set the username to `root`.

b. Run the following commands to check if the query is successful:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(a int);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1), (2);

SELECT * FROM t1;
```
