# Sqllogic test

The database return right with different handlers, for example mysql and http

# Usage

## Prepare
Change to the scripts dir:
```shell
cd tests/logictest/
```

Make sure python3 is installed.

You can use [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to install dependency, dependency see tests/pyproject.toml

If you are familiar with `pip`, you can install dependency with:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Need to know
1. Cases from **tests/suites/0_stateless/**  to  **tests/logictest/suites/gen/**
2. If a case file already exists in gen/, gen_suites will ignore it. 
3. Regenerateï¼šdelete case file in gen/ and run gen_suites.py

## Generate sqllogic test cases from Stateless Test
1. python3 gen_suites.py

## Usage
You can simply run all tests with:
```shell
python main.py
```

Get help with:
```shell
python main.py -h
```

## Docker

### Build image

docker build -t sqllogic/test:latest .

### Run with docker

1. Image release: datafuselabs/sqllogictest:latest
2. Set envs
- SKIP_TEST_FILES (skip test case, set file name here split by `,` )
- QUERY_MYSQL_HANDLER_HOST
- QUERY_MYSQL_HANDLER_PORT
- QUERY_HTTP_HANDLER_HOST
- QUERY_HTTP_HANDLER_PORT
- MYSQL_DATABASE
- MYSQL_USER
- ADDITIONAL_HEADERS (for security scenario)
3. docker run --name logictest --rm --network host datafuselabs/sqllogictest:latest

## Write logic test tips

1. skipif  help you skip test of given handler
```
skipif clickhouse
statement query I
select 1;

----
1
```

2. onlyif help you run test only by given handler
```
onlyif mysql
statement query I
select 1;

----
1
```

3. if some test has flaky failure, and you want ignore it, simply add skipped before statement query.(Remove it after problem solved)
```
statement query skipped I
select 1;

----
1
```

**tips** If you do not care about result, use statement ok instead of statement query
**warning** A statement query need result, and even if you want to skip a case, you still need to keep the results in the test content
